            <p id="about-paragraph">My name is Muhammad Uquaily, a 13-year-old exploring software development through Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer course. This journey is enhancing my coding skills and showing me the creative potential of programming. My hobbies outside coding include football, which hones my teamwork and strategic thinking, and reading, which broadens my horizons. I maintain a fitness routine for physical and mental well-being. You can follow my coding adventure and personal growth on Instagram <a href="instagram.com/muhammaduquaily" target="_blank">@muhammaduquaily</a>, where I share updates and connect with the coding community.

                The journey through Codecademy has led me to create several projects that I am incredibly proud of. These projects were not just assignments; they were opportunities for me to apply what I had learned in real-world scenarios. Before Codecademy, the thought of writing a line of code was foreign to me, but now I can confidently build web applications. The website you are currently viewing is my latest project, showcasing my skills as of April 10, 2024. This site is a testament to my growth as a developer, illustrating my ability to integrate both front-end and back-end technologies to create a fully functional web experience. The fortune button you see is another project inspired by Codecademy which is a random message generator but is customly changed by myself. <br><br> <strong id="fortune">Random Fortune</strong>

        The Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Course has been an incredible journey of growth and learning. In just three months, I've acquired a wealth of knowledge and skills that span the full stack of web development. From front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enable me to craft beautiful and responsive websites, to back-end skills involving Node.js and database management, my capabilities have expanded significantly. This course has not only taught me how to code but also how to think like a developer, problem-solve efficiently, and work on complex projects with confidence.
