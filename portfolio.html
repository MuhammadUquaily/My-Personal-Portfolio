                <p id="projects-paragraph">
                    All the projects that I have created have only been made on or because of Codecademy. I never new how to code before Codecademy and I am still learning. Here are some checkpoints of my progress throughout the course. The website you are currently on, as of April 10 2024 is the latest project I have completed.

                Limerick Coding Club is a project I completed alone. It is a made up coding club from a county in Ireland. It talks about the Joys of the club, what a day there is like, and has a testimonial from it's founder - Muhammad Uquaily.

                Form a story was another website introduced by Codecademy to practice using HTML forms. It takes in info from the user and then proceedes to show you the story the user has personally created. If you don't like the story you can see the original instead.

            These are some of the skills I can proudly say I have as i have worked on, honed, and gained the right to say I can perform these skills with little to no problem. This was after 3 months of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Course.
